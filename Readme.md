About
========================
This is a gpu fluid simulation.
Simulation method is position based smooth particle hydrodynamics (Miles Macklin, Matthias Muller: "Position Based Fluids", 2013)

Usage
========================
To run you would need an 
- nvidia GPU with computing capability at least 2.0 (most graphics cards in past 5 years)
- Windows 64 bit
- Opengl

To compile this project you would need VS 2013 and CUDA Computing Toolkit V7.5

Hotkeys
========================
- Use arrows to control camera rotation
- W/A/S/D to control gravity
- E/R Decrease/Increase viscosity
- T/Y Decrease/Increae solver iteration count
- Space to drop another bunch of particles
